The markdown is then generated into HTML through a Vue library in Nuxt. Nuxt and Vue are able to generate the pages statically so that you'll be able to get a *blazing fast user experience*!\n\n### To show my gratitude, I have linked some cat gifs below! Enjoy! 🐈🐱 🐈🐱 🐈🐱\n\n![](/img/giphy.gif)\n\n![](/img/cat.gif)"
