Here are 3 reasons why you should put the leash on your cat and not just your dog.\n\n![](/img/catleash.gif)\n\n## 1. A Happy Cat Leads to Reduced Behavioral Problems\n\nCats who are happy will not feel the need to act out in the home. Cats are exploratory animals who will feel the need to get rid of excess energy they have by exploring their environment. Thus, putting your cat on the leash may lead to less instances of scratched up furniture!\n\n## 2. More Exercise May Give Your Cat a Longer, Happier Life\n\nCats are creatures who may sometimes have problems with controlling their appetite. By giving your cat an outlet to frequent exercise, they will be given the opportunity to burn off those excess calories! Thus, it's a good idea to get the cat on the leash when you can. A nice walk can help keep away the excess pounds.\n\n## 3. Cats Can Explore Into Their Natural Predatory Instincts\n\nIndoor cats do not get too many outlets to be able to explore their natural predatory instincts. However, an outdoor environment will be able to engage your cats with tons of ambient outdoor sounds, sights, and smells all around him! It is important though that they are able to explore the environment at their own pace rather than hastily pulling him along from one location to another. Putting some treats along the way may help encourage him to continue to explore his environment.\n\n#### And... that's it! Happy cat walking!"
